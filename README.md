# WebScraping
Web Scraping data using Python is a useful skill in order to get insights from different sources of data.
I've made some projects to showcase this scrapings:

**(1) - Web Scraping With Python â€” Get the Top 100 Most-Streamed Songs on Spotify**
https://medium.com/better-programming/web-scraping-with-python-top-100-most-streamed-songs-on-spotify-5cddb95d4175

In this project I've scraped data from Wikipedia. The data concerns the top100 most-streamed songs of 2022 on Spotify.
This project was made only to show the techniques and libraries used to scrape the data, and had not the purpose of exploring or getting insights/visualization from it.
