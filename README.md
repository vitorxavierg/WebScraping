# WebScraping
Web scraping is a useful skill in order to get insights from different sources of data.
I've made some projects using Python to showcase it:

**(1) - Web Scraping With Python â€” Get the Top 100 Most-Streamed Songs on Spotify**
https://medium.com/better-programming/web-scraping-with-python-top-100-most-streamed-songs-on-spotify-5cddb95d4175

In this project I've scraped data from Wikipedia. The data concerns the top100 most-streamed songs of 2022 on Spotify.
This project was made only to show the techniques and libraries used to scrape the data, and had not the purpose of exploring or getting insights/visualization from it.

**(2) - Cars Prices & Reviews Study - [1/3]: Data Scraping**
https://medium.com/towardsdev/cars-prices-reviews-study-step-1-data-scraping-8089ac94389

This is the first part of a three-part project I've made. In the first part, it's used BeautifulSoup and Selenium libs to scrape data from a selling cars website.
Check out the medium article to read the other to parts.
